AndroidX86InstallerApp
======================

Android Application to install Android-X86 (see www.android-x86.org) from live-cd or upgrade from running installation

What doesn't work:
- Legacy-Grub cannot be installed (Cannot run 'grub' binary)
- Cannot partition disks (not yet implemented)
- Do not format selected disk (default preference. Not yet implemented)
- UnitTest (created this project to learn Android App programming...more a hack. Will be fixed :-))
